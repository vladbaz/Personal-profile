			to the educational level of an Australian bachelor Degree<br></p>
            <p>I am a football fun and like to watch football matches on TV.</p>
    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
     <p>I am interested in IT from my childhood. My uncle was a computer programmer, I read one of his book and other books about computers. 
	    I got some experience in mainframe programming when I was studying in university. As first personal computers became available, 
		I bought one of them. It could be programmed in Assembler and Basic and did some programming. 
		But western personal computers were not affordable in USSR and Russia and my career went to Mechanical Engineering. 
		When difficulties started to find a job for Mechanical Engineer, I had got a degree in area of IT 
		and worked as a system administrator for UNIX systems and help IT officer in one company in Russia. After my migration to Australia, 
		I worked as proprietary software developer and help IT officer here.
	 </p>
	 <p>The course Bachelor of IT in RMIT is suitable for me by its syllabus and because it has four study periods per year, 
	    this allows to distribute studying load more evenly. RMIT has a pretty high rank among Australian universities.
	 </p>
	 <p>During studying, I expect to improve my skills in programming languages Python, C++ and Java, and learn a new for me programming language C#.
        Also, the area of web and UI design is interesting for me.
	 </p>

	   <h2>Project Idea</h2>
	     <h3>Overview</h3>
		    <p>The proposed project is from area of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is an idea to connect various devices to the Internet and to other connected devices. 
		    All those devices collect information about how they are used and environment to store it in data bases for future analysis. 
			Also connected devices can exchange messages between themselves to to take some actions. 
			Examples of that can be smart microwaves, self-driving cars, fitness devices, etc.<br> 
            Objects with inserted sensors are connected with a IoT platform through Internet and the IoT platform process data 
			using deployed software applications for analysis and intercommunication of devices.<br>
            The proposed project is to build a such IoT device with a soil moisture and temperature sensor.</p>
		<h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>Such a device can be used to measure soil moisture and temperature in the area of roots of plants what is important information for agricultural purposes. 
			If such device is connected, through an IoT platform, to devices controlling watering equipment, they can form a self-regulated system for plant watering. 
			This can be useful for both agricultural farms and non-agricultural plant growers, organisations and private individuals.<br>
            Needless to say that there is a lot potential customers of such systems. There is a huge amount of farms in the world and many of them can not 
            afford current expensive telemetry systems used in agriculture. The proposed device uses free open source and inexpensive hardware and software 
			that significantly reduces the cost of the system.</p>
		<h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The proposed device will support IoT technology based on LoRaWAN. LoRa is a radio-modulation which has high resistance to outside interference. 
			The technology is owned by the company SEMTECH. LoRaWAN is high level network protocol defined by LoRa Alliance as “a Low Power, 
			Wide Area (LPWA) networking protocol designed to wirelessly connect battery operated ‘things’ to the internet in regional, 
			national or global networks, and targets key Internet of Things (IoT) requirements such as bi-directional communication, 
			end-to-end security, mobility and localisation services”.</p>
			<p><b>LoRaWAN® Network Architecture</b></p>
			<img src="https://lora-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LA-TC-Stack-01-1536x708.png" width="1000" height="450" alt="LoRa Netwotrk Architecture"/><br>
			<p>LoraWAN operates inside license-free sub-gigahertz bands; it is AU915-928/AS923-1 (915–928 MHz for Australia and 2.4GHz worldwide. 
			The distance between a device and gateway can be up to ~12 km (depends of conditions). 
			LoraWAN protocol is intended for transmission of small messages to/from device at low data rate. 
			It needs a very low power consumption, which allows devices to work years without changing batteries.<br>
            The proposed device (node in LoraWAN terminology) will be connected to a LoraWAN provider 
			<a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org"> The Things Network</a> (TTN). 
			The Things Network states that it is a global collaborative Internet of Things ecosystem 
			that creates networks, devices and solutions using LoRaWAN. The Things Network provides a set of open tools and a global, 
			open network to build your next IoT application at low cost, featuring maximum security and ready to scale.<br>			
            TTN has capabilities to redirect messages from nodes to a number of cloud IoT platforms where data can be processed, 
			analysed and graphically represented. One of such providers is <a href="https://developers.mydevices.com">Cayenne</a> . 
			Developers can easily build drag-and-drop graphical dashboards using large set of widgets there. 
			It is free of charge for developers with a small number of devices.<br>
            The device itself is built on the base of an <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/retired/boards/arduino-pro-mini">Arduino</a> compatible board. 
			To be specific, that is a modified Arduino Pro Mini compatible board which has a very low power consumption 
			that is important for building battery applications.<br>
            The microprocessor board will be connected with a capacitor soil moisture sensor which measures the volumetric water content in soil. 
			Capacitor soil moisture sensors are inexpensive and more reliable than other types of sensors. 
			The sensor measures soil temperature as well because this characteristic of soil is important for agricultural works. 
			The sensor is connected to the board using I2C interface. This interface is used very often to connect electronic components 
			with others and there are many software libraries to program it.<br>
            In order to conduct Lora modulated radio communications, the microprocessor board will be connected with radio module RFM95W which 
			is compatible with Semtech SX1276 chip. This module has low power consumption and is suitable for battery applications.<br>
            The board and radio module will be mounted inside of a sealed, rugged weather resistant enclosure that allows to use the device 
			in harsh agricultural conditions. It will be provided with reboot button and LED indicators to operate more conveniently.</p>
         <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            <p>LoraWAN software compatible with the Arduino hardware system is needed to build a LoraWAN node. One of such software is a 
			library named <a href="https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic">Arduino-LMIC library</a> ("MCCI LoRaWAN LMIC Library"). It is open source, 
			free of charge to use and is a modification of IBM LMIC node package, developed by IBM, for use with Arduino boards. 
            Devices powered by batteries need to minimise their power consumption. To achieve that, microprocessor of the node should be put into “sleep” 
			mode during the period between data transmission. Software package <a href="https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power">“Low-Power”</a> 
			by "Rocket Scream” is a lightweight low power library for Arduino. An Integrated Development Environment to program Arduino boards is 
			<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">Arduino IDE or Arduino Web Editor</a>.</p>	
          <h3>Skills Required</h3>
            <p>A software to program an Arduino board should be developed so the completion of project needs some skills in using programming language C and Arduino IDE. 
			Also, some basic knowledge of microprocessors, electronics and radio waves are necessary too. Having some ideas about how the I2C protocol works will be useful as well.
            Assembling the node will need some basic skills in soldering, and manufacturing the enclosure can demand some skills in material processing and handling power tools.</p>
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
            In the case of successful completion of the project the outcome will be a compact and lightweight device which will be capable to transmit data 
			about soil moisture and soil temperature to TTN and these data will be visualised on a graphical dashboard which will be accessible through Internet. 
            It will provide a capability of remote monitoring important agricultural soil conditions at remote areas at any time without need to travel to 
			these areas and conduct measurements by agricultural workers themselves. It will dramatically save work time for agricultural and civil workers.
            Owners of small gardens and single plants would be able to be notified when the plants should be watered.
